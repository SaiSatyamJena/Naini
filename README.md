Meet **NainiV1**, an agentic AI designed specifically for the challenges of geological data analysis. Traditional geological documents often contain complex tables, diagrams, and unstructured text, making automated data extraction difficult. Naini tackles this head-on using a **state-of-the-art, self-developed parsing pipeline**. This custom logic intelligently combines the strengths of tools like **Camelot** and **img2table** (among others) to meticulously extract information even from challenging visual formats.

The "brain" behind Naini is a highly **optimized Qwen2 7-billion parameter model**. This powerful LLM has been fine-tuned specifically for geological interpretation tasks, allowing it to understand context and provide insightful analysis based on the parsed data.

The result? NainiV1 is:
*   **üí° Intelligent:** Understands and interprets geological data.
*   **‚ö° Lightning-Fast:** Optimized for rapid inference.
*   **üéØ Accurate:** Fine-tuned for high precision in geological tasks.
*   **üíª Fully Local:** Runs entirely on your own machine. No data leaves your system.
*   **üí∞ Cost-Free:** **Zero reliance on paid APIs.**
*   **üìâ Lightweight:** Operates effectively with approximately **14GB of VRAM**.

NainiV1 empowers geoscientists and researchers by providing a powerful, private, and efficient tool for unlocking insights hidden within their documents.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Follow these steps to get NainiV1 running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your GitHub Repository Link]
    cd NainiV1 # Or your repository's directory name
    ```

2.  **Set up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate the environment:
    # Linux/macOS:
    source venv/bin/activate
    # Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: Depending on your system and CUDA version, you might need specific versions of PyTorch or other GPU-related libraries. Consult their official documentation if you encounter issues.*

4.  **Download the Fine-Tuned Qwen2 Model:**
    *   You need to obtain the fine-tuned Qwen2 7B model files used by NainiV1.
    *   **[IMPORTANT: Provide clear instructions here. Examples:]**
        *   *Option A (If hosting on Hugging Face):* "Download the model files from our Hugging Face repository: [Link to HF Repo]. Place them in the `models/` directory."
        *   *Option B (If providing download script):* "Run the download script: `python download_model.py`. The model will be saved to the `models/` directory."
        *   *Option C (Manual download link):* "Download the model archive [Link to model file/archive] and extract its contents into the `models/` directory within this project."
    *   Ensure the application knows where to find the model (you might need a configuration file or environment variable).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1.  **Prepare Your Input:** Ensure your geological document (e.g., PDF, image file) is ready.

2.  **Run the Application:**
    Execute the main script from your terminal. Adjust the command based on your specific script and arguments:

    ```bash
    python main.py --input_path /path/to/your/document.pdf [Other arguments like --output_path, etc.]
    ```

    *   Replace `/path/to/your/document.pdf` with the actual path to your input file.
    *   Include any other necessary command-line arguments (e.g., `--output_dir`, `--config_file`). List and explain the key arguments here:
        *   `--input_path`: **Required.** Path to the input geological document (PDF, JPG, PNG, etc.).
        *   `--output_dir`: *Optional.* Directory to save results (default: `output/`).
        *   `[--another_arg]`: *[Explain other important arguments]*.

3.  **Check the Output:**
    NainiV1 will process the document and generate its analysis. The output might include:
    *   Extracted tables (e.g., as CSV files).
    *   A summary report (e.g., a text file).
    *   Annotated images or diagrams.
    *   [Describe the specific output format(s) Naini produces].
    Check the specified output directory (or the default `output/` directory).
